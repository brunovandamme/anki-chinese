# anki-chinese
Create anki cards for studying chinese vocabulary

This python script reads the files from the input directory and exports anki-importable files in the output directory.
A file is created for each lesson, and there is a global export file which contains all cards.
Every card contains hanzi, pinyin, translation and pronounciation. Pinyin and hanzi fields are colored to indicate tones.
